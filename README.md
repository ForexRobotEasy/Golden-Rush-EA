## Description

The Golden Rush EA is a trading robot that opens buy and sell orders based on the crossing of moving averages. It uses three moving averages with different periods to determine the entry conditions.

The main function of the EA is to calculate the moving averages on different time frames and check if the entry conditions are met. If the moving averages are in the correct order, a buy or sell order is opened with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit values.

The EA also includes an initialization function, an event handler for tick updates, and a deinitialization function for cleanup tasks before the program exits.

Please note that this code is a simplified version for demonstration purposes and may not include all the features and error handling of the official Golden Rush EA.

1. Include the necessary libraries and dependencies in your MetaTrader project.
